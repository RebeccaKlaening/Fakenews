	 	Master Wayne, you\'ve been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway.

We can teach you how to engage 600.You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can\'t take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don\'t care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can\'t stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I\'m always smiling. Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?',

Good luck.But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you\'d be spared your pain. But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege. I just want my phone call. Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne? Hero can be anyone.
