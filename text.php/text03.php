'To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you\'d be spared your pain. But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege. I just want my phone call. Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne? Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn\'t ended. I\'m flesh and blood.';
