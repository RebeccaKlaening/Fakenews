It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can\'t stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling. Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?
