It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face.

She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling. Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?
It was a dog.
