You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham.And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.
It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
